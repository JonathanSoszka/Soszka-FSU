# CDA 3101 Project 2: MIPPS Simulator

### Requirements
- simulator should read a machine code file that was output from the previous assignment.
- The machine code file is specified as the first argument
on the command line. For instance, if your solutionâ€™s executable is named sim.exe and the machine code file
to be simulated is named sum.obj, then you should use the following command to simulate the execution.
% sim.exe sum.obj
- After reading the instructions and the data, the simulator should start the simulation from the first instruction in the
machine code file and should continue the simulation until it encounters a syscall thatexits.
- required to simulate all the types of instructions specified in the previous assignment.

| 5                |               | Read an integer value from standard input and assign the value to $v0.     |
| 10               |               | Exit the simulation.                                                       |
