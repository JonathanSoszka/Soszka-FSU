# Class Structure

## Simulator

- Main class
- default constructor with no arguments
- Open(file) method opens the target file for processing
- Run() method simulates the instructions in the designated file, throw error if no file is provided
- Parse() method iterates through the file using standard IO and creats two vectors of instructions, _Data, and _Text


# Run Steps (to be perfomed for each instruction)

-Get Opcode

 -if opcode == 0 then get $rd,$rs,$rt, and funct
 -else determine encoding type
 - if (i) then get $rs,$rt, and immediate
 - if (j) then get target addr
 - if syscall call syscall function


 -call instruction method with correct paramaters

V1 Get simulator class framed and file I/O handled. Create vector for registers, and empty instruction functions
V2 Create methods for instruction decoding, call empty instruction functions
V3 Create First instruction functions and test simulator
